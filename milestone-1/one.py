# âœ… Task:
# Write a Python program that:
#   Defines a Person class with:
#       Attributes: name, age
#       Method: greet() that prints: "Hi, my name is <name> and I am <age> years old."
#       Asks the user to input their name and age.
#           Instantiates a Person object and calls the greet() method.
#           Adds a function is_minor() that checks if the person is under 18, returning True or False.
#                   If the user is a minor, print: "You are a minor."
#                   Otherwise, print: "You are an adult."
