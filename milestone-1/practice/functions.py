Function Design Process

1. What task do I want this functon to do?
    e.g I want this function to calculate the area of a triangle
2. What DATA(INPUTS) does this function needs to do this tasks?
    Example: length and width â†’ def area(length, width)
3. What should it return (if anything)?
    should it give back a result or just perform an action
    example: return length*width
4. How will you name it?
    Use clear, descriptive names. Should indicate what the function does
